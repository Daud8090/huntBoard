# huntBoard - a job portal for me

here is the product description

🔥 Job Aggregator + Application Tracker – Full Project Breakdown

✅ Main Features

1. Search Job Listings from Multiple Platforms
User enters a job title (e.g., "Node.js Developer")

Backend fetches jobs from:
🔹 LinkedIn (limited scraping; mostly manual)
🔹 Naukri.com (scraping or unofficial API)
🔹 Hirist
🔹 Instahyre (can be scraped or automated with Playwright)

Combine results and return them to frontend.


2. Display Results in Frontend (MUI + RTK Query)
Show:
Job Title
Company
Salary (if available)
Platform (e.g., Hirist, LinkedIn)
Posting Date
Apply button → opens job link in new tab
Optional: MUI Tabs for filtering by platform.

3. Track Applied Jobs
Add a button on each job: Mark as Applied
When clicked, store it in your own DB:
{
  jobId,
  platform,
  appliedAt,
  jobDetails: {...}
}

Show ✔️ Applied badge on jobs already marked

Add “My Applications” tab to view your applied jobs only.


4. Job Detail Page (Optional)
Clicking a job shows a details page (optional).
Otherwise, clicking Apply redirects to the original job post link.
💻 Frontend Stack
React
RTK Query (for fetching from your own backend)
MUI for UI

Local Storage or backend-linked user profile for tracking

⚙️ Backend Stack
Node.js + Express
Scraping with:
Playwright (best for sites with dynamic content)
OR Cheerio + Axios (for static HTML parsing)

MongoDB / file-based DB to store applied jobs

🌐 Scraping Strategy (Realistic Approach)
Platform	Method	                    Notes
LinkedIn	❌ Hard (no public API)	Can open search URLs, but data is obfuscated
Naukri.com	✅ Scraping possible	Use query params like job title, location
Hirist	✅ Can be scraped	Search page has structured data
Instahyre	✅ Playwright best	Auth required, dynamic content
🧠 Smart Enhancements
Show jobs in a card layout with badges (e.g., platform)

Auto-save search history

Add "applied" flag to show status across sessions

Backend cache/search jobs to avoid re-scraping too often

🔐 Optional: Auth Layer
Let user create an account (email + password or Google login)

So "applied jobs" can be stored per-user
